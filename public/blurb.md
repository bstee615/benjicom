# About me

I have two years of experience as a software developer in freelance and formal team environments. I recently graduated in May 2019 from Bob Jones University, an academically rigorous private Christian university in Greenville, SC.

My favorite part of the job is developing with my team and working with my customers to create cool & useful applications. I love the process of hashing out the client's requirements, researching and learning new tech, and building an efficient & elegant solution.

I am looking for a job in Software Development. Ultimately, my goal is to pursue research; I am taking some time off for work before I begin graduate school.
